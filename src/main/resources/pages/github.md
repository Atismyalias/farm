0crat GitHub bot understands these commands:

  * `help`: shows most relevant assisting information

  * `hello`: just says "hi"

  * `in`: I will add that ticket to the project scope. You must
    be in either ARC or PO roles to do that.

  * `out`: I will remove that ticket from the project scope. You must
    be either ARC or PO to do that.
